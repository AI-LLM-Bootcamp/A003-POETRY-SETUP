    "# Quick Guide: How to work with the exercises files\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with a GitHub repository that uses Poetry for dependency management involves a few straightforward steps. Here's a simple guide on how to download the repository, set it up, and start working with it using Poetry and the Poetry shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Download or clone the Github Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to download the files to your computer. You can easily do so through the GitHub website. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to download a repository as a ZIP file:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Navigate to the repository's page on GitHub using any web browser.\n",
    "* Find the green button labeled **Code** near the top of the repository page.\n",
    "* Click on this button, and you will see an option to **Download ZIP**.\n",
    "* Click on **Download ZIP**. This will download a ZIP file of the entire repository to your computer.\n",
    "* Locate the ZIP file in your downloads folder or wherever your downloads are typically saved. Extract the files from the ZIP file to a directory of your choice on your computer. This can typically be done by right-clicking on the ZIP file and selecting an option like \"Extract All,\" \"Unzip,\" or \"Extract Here,\" depending on your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you to download the repo following the previous steps. If you prefer to clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine, you'll need Git installed and write the following in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "Replace `https://github.com/username/repository-name.git` with the actual URL of the GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the repository is downloaded, you need to navigate into the project directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd project-name\n",
    "```\n",
    "Replace `project-name` with the name of the folder that Git created when you downloaded or cloned the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Make sure you have the right Python version active in the directory\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you do not have Python 3.11.4 active, make sure you have [Python 3.11.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed in your computer and set it active executing the following line in your terminal:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pyenv local 3.11.4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Install Dependencies with Poetry\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can start working, you need to install all the dependencies specified in the project's `pyproject.toml` file. If the project is set up with Poetry, you should see this file in the project directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "poetry install\n",
    "```\n",
    "This command tells Poetry to read the `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files and install all the necessary dependencies into a virtual environment specifically for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Activate the Poetry Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "To work within the virtual environment managed by Poetry, you can activate the Poetry shell. This will ensure that any Python commands, scripts, or additional packages you install are confined to this environment, preventing conflicts with other projects or system-wide Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "poetry shell\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once this command is executed, your terminal is now operating within the virtual environment. You’ll usually see the environment’s name prefixed to your terminal prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Open the Jupyter Notebooks included in the project\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Lab is already installed in the project. In order to open it in your browser and open the notebooks included in the project, run the following line in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter lab\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once this command is executed, jupyter lab will be opened in your browser. Go there, open the directory of files and select the jupyter notebook you want to open.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember the basic instructions to work with a Notebook**:\n",
    "* Notebooks read code from top to bottom. If you execute one cell but the previous cells have not been executed, you will probably get an error.\n",
    "* To execute one single cell in a notebook, click shift+enter\n",
    "* To execute all cells in a notebook, go to the top navigation, select Run and then select Run All Cells in the dropdown menu.\n",
    "* If the notebook does not work correctly, the first step to solve a proble will be to go to the top navigation, select Run and then select Restrart Kernel and Run All Cells in the dropdown menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 7: Run the python files included in the code editor\n",
    "\n",
    "Open Visual Studio Code (recommended) or your editor of choice. See there the python files included in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the environment set up and activated, you can now run the Python files included in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "If there's a file you want to run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python file_name.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "Replace `file_name.py` with the name of the Python file you want to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 8: Exiting the Poetry Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're done working, you can exit the Poetry shell to return to your system’s normal environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "exit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 9: Re-activating Poetry Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to continue working with the project after exiting, you can re-activate the Poetry shell to return to the virtual environment of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "poetry shell\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps provide a clean and isolated way to work on Python projects that use Poetry, ensuring that all dependencies are correctly managed and conflicts are minimized. This method is particularly useful when contributing to or testing out projects in a development setting."
