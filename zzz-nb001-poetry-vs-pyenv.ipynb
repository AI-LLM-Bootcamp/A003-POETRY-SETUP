    "## Pros and Cons of Using Poetry vs. Pyenv\n",
    "* **We often prefer to use Pyenv because it is lightweight, fast, and user-friendly**. You will frequently see us incorporating it into many of our exercises and projects.\n",
    "* However, one limitation of using Pyenv is that it does not control the package versions installed for each exercise. Given that LangChain rapidly evolves, this could sometimes result in your code not working as expected or triggering deprecation warnings.\n",
    "* While this might seem like a drawback, it actually serves as a valuable learning opportunity. It highlights areas where LangChain has advanced, prompting you to engage in research, experimentation, and problem-solving. This process mirrors the real-life tasks of an AI Engineer.\n",
    "* **On the other hand, Poetry allows us to ensure that you use precisely the same package versions that were used when creating an exercise or project**. This consistency is particularly beneficial if you are a beginner, as it allows you to focus on learning without worrying about compatibility issues.\n",
    "* **Another interesting advantage: using poetry makes it easier for us to present you the projects in two different ways**:\n",
    "    * In notebooks, the best tool to learn.\n",
    "    * In Visual Studio Code, the way most professional AI Engineers work.\n",
    "* However, it's important to recognize that this consistency does not reflect the typical professional environment. In the real world, AI Engineers are expected to continually study, investigate, experiment, and resolve problems.\n",
    "* Therefore, while we use Poetry for more basic exercises to provide a stable learning environment, be mindful that this comes with the drawback of potentially missing out on the latest package updates. This approach helps you learn in a more controlled setting, but remember, the real world often demands adaptability and continuous learning."

    "## Main differences between poetry and pyenv\n",
    "**Poetry** and **pyenv** are both useful tools in the Python development ecosystem, but they serve different purposes. Here’s a simple explanation of their main differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pyenv\n",
    "**pyenv** is a tool specifically designed to manage multiple versions of Python itself on your computer. It allows you to switch between different versions of Python easily, depending on your project needs. This is especially useful when different projects require different Python versions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features of pyenv**:\n",
    "- **Version Management**: You can install multiple versions of Python and switch between them.\n",
    "- **Local and Global Settings**: You can set a global default Python version for your system, or specify a local version for individual projects.\n",
    "- **Compatibility**: Works with various Python versions, including CPython, PyPy, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Use**: Choosing and switching between different Python versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Poetry\n",
    "**Poetry** is a dependency management and packaging tool in the Python ecosystem. Its main purpose is to handle library dependencies for Python projects, ensuring that you have all the right libraries (and their correct versions) needed for your projects. It also helps package and distribute Python software.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features of Poetry**:\n",
    "- **Dependency Management**: Automatically manages and installs libraries that your project depends on, according to specified versions in your project files.\n",
    "- **Virtual Environments**: Creates and manages virtual environments for your projects, isolating project dependencies from each other.\n",
    "- **Package Creation**: Helps you build and publish your own Python packages easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Use**: Managing project-specific libraries and dependencies, and handling project environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Main Differences\n",
    "- **Purpose**: pyenv manages Python versions (i.e., the Python interpreter itself), while Poetry manages Python packages (libraries) and project environments.\n",
    "- **Project Isolation**: Poetry creates virtual environments to isolate project dependencies, which pyenv does not handle directly.\n",
    "- **Dependency Resolution**: Poetry automatically resolves and installs all dependencies a project might need, which is beyond the scope of pyenv’s functionality."

    "## How to install poetry in your computer\n",
    "Installing Poetry is straightforward. Here’s a simple guide on how to do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open Your Terminal\n",
    "You’ll need to use a terminal (command prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS, or any terminal application on Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing Poetry using Homebrew (commonly known as `brew`) is a straightforward method, especially if you're using macOS or Linux. Homebrew simplifies the installation process by handling everything automatically. Here's how you can install Poetry with Homebrew:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: Install poetry using Homebrew\n",
    "If you don’t already have Homebrew installed on your system, you'll need to install it first. Once Homebrew is installed and updated, you can install Poetry by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "brew install poetry\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command tells Homebrew to download and install the latest version of Poetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Install poetry by running the Installation Script\n",
    "Poetry provides a custom installer that handles everything for you. To install Poetry, you just need to run the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what this command does:\n",
    "- `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org`: This part downloads the installation script from Poetry’s official website. `curl` is a tool to transfer data from or to a server. The `-sSL` flags make the output silent and enable SSL for security.\n",
    "- `| python3 -`: This part pipes (transfers) the downloaded script into Python to execute it. The script automatically installs Poetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verify the Installation\n",
    "After the installation script has finished running, you can check that Poetry was installed correctly by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "poetry --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command should display the version of Poetry that was installed, indicating that the installation was successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configure Your System (if necessary)\n",
    "In some cases, you might need to close and reopen your terminal or even restart your computer to make sure that the Poetry commands are recognized. This ensures that the path to Poetry is added to your system's environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Start Using Poetry\n",
    "Now that Poetry is installed, you can start using it to manage Python projects. For example, you can create a new project with `poetry new project-name` or add dependencies with `poetry add package-name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps should help you get Poetry up and running smoothly on your machine!"

    "## How poetry works: Basic Guide\n",
    "Poetry is a tool that helps manage a Python project’s dependencies (which are basically other pieces of software that your project needs to function) and packages in a straightforward and efficient way. Here’s a simple breakdown of how Poetry works, using a basic example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating a new project**: Suppose you want to start a new Python project called \"AmazingProject\". With Poetry, you can set up the new project and its environment quickly. You'd open your terminal (a program that allows you to type and execute text-based commands) and run:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   poetry new AmazingProject\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This command creates a new folder named \"AmazingProject\" with a standard project structure, including folders for your code and tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adding dependencies**: Let's say your project needs a library called `requests` to download data from the internet. Instead of manually downloading and installing `requests`, you just tell Poetry to handle it by running:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   poetry add requests\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Poetry will find the latest compatible version of `requests`, download it, and install it. It also keeps track of this dependency in a file called `pyproject.toml`, which is like a list of all the ingredients your project needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Locking dependencies**: Alongside `pyproject.toml`, Poetry creates a `poetry.lock` file. This file locks your dependencies to specific versions that you know work. This means that no matter where or when you set up your project, Poetry will ensure that it uses the exact versions listed in the `poetry.lock` file, avoiding problems that might arise from unexpected updates or changes in those dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Installing the project**: If you or someone else wants to start working with your project on a different computer, you can use:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   poetry install\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This command reads the `poetry.lock` file and installs exactly the same versions of all dependencies that were used in the original project setup. This ensures that the project behaves the same way across different environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Updating dependencies**: If you need to update a library to a newer version, you can run:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   poetry update requests\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Poetry will find the latest version that is compatible with your project, update the `poetry.lock` file, and ensure that everything still works together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these steps, Poetry simplifies the management of project dependencies, making it easier to develop, maintain, and share Python projects without running into \"it works on my machine\" issues."

    "## Using poetry to create a virtual environment\n",
    "The `poetry shell` command is a useful feature of Poetry for managing Python environments. It simplifies the process of activating the virtual environment associated with your project. Let's break down how this works with a straightforward example.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a Virtual Environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, a virtual environment in Python is like a contained workspace where you can install and manage packages separately from those installed globally on your computer. This helps avoid conflicts between project requirements and ensures that each project has access to only the libraries it needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using `poetry shell`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how `poetry shell` works in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup**: Assume you've already created a project using Poetry, as described earlier. Within your project directory, you have a virtual environment that Poetry automatically manages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Activating the Virtual Environment**:\n",
    "   - Normally, to use this virtual environment, you'd need to activate it manually with a specific command that depends on your operating system.\n",
    "   - With `poetry shell`, you simplify this step. By running the command `poetry shell` in your terminal (while you're in the project directory), Poetry will activate the virtual environment for you.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   cd AmazingProject   # Navigate to your project directory if you're not already there\n",
    "   poetry shell        # Activates the virtual environment\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   After this command, your terminal session is now within the virtual environment. This means any Python commands you run or any Python packages you install will only affect this environment, not your global Python setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Working in the Activated Environment**:\n",
    "   - Once the shell is activated, you can run Python scripts, use Python interactively, or install more packages using `poetry add [package-name]`, and these actions will only apply to your project’s environment.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   - Running a script:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     python my_script.py  # Runs using the Python interpreter in the virtual environment\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Adding a new package:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     poetry add numpy     # Installs numpy in the virtual environment\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Exiting the Shell**:\n",
    "   - When you’re done working in the virtual environment, you can exit the shell by typing `exit` or pressing `Ctrl+D`. This will return you to the normal terminal environment, deactivating the virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   exit  # Exit the poetry virtual environment\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "5. **Re-opening the virtual environment**\n",
    "   - By running the command `poetry shell` in your terminal (while you're in the project directory), Poetry will re-activate the virtual environment for you.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   cd AmazingProject   # Navigate to your project directory if you're not already there\n",
    "   poetry shell        # Re-activates the virtual environment\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `poetry shell` effectively encapsulates your work in a clean, organized manner, keeping all dependencies aligned with the project needs and ensuring consistency across different working environments. This makes it easier to manage projects and collaborate with others."
